Hi, I'm Mike. I'm a full stack developer at SalesLoft living in Atlanta, Georgia. At the moment I primarily work with Ruby and the Rails framework as well as Javascript frameworks like Angular. Recently I've been experimenting with other JS frameworks like React and Ember. Outside of developing I enjoy being active and spend most of my time playing ice hockey and lifting weights.

I'm passionate about startups, tech innovation, social good and athletics. If you'd like to contact me for your next project you can send me an email at [michael.sandt@gmail.com](mailto:michael.sandt@gmail.com)
